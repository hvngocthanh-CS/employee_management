"""
Department API Router
=====================
Endpoints for managing departments.

Demonstrates:
  - GET /departments - list all
  - GET /departments/{id} - get one
  - POST /departments - create
  - PUT /departments/{id} - update
  - DELETE /departments/{id} - delete
  - GET /departments/search - advanced search (SQL: ILIKE, HAVING, dynamic ORDER BY)
  - POST /departments/compare - compare multiple departments (SQL: window functions, ranking)
  - GET /departments/{id}/employees - paginated employee list (SQL: OFFSET/LIMIT)

    Advanced department search with filters and sorting.
    
    SQL Learning Points:
    - ILIKE '%pattern%' for case-insensitive pattern matching
    - HAVING clause for filtering aggregated data (vs WHERE for raw data)
    - Dynamic ORDER BY based on request parameters
    - OFFSET/LIMIT for pagination
    - Multiple LEFT JOINs: departments → employees → salaries
    
    Query Parameters:
      name: Search in department name (case-insensitive)
      min_employees: Filter departments with at least N employees
      max_employees: Filter departments with at most N employees
      min_avg_salary: Filter departments with average salary >= N
      max_avg_salary: Filter departments with average salary <= N
      sort_by: Sort by 'name', 'employee_count', or 'avg_salary'
      order: 'asc' (ascending) or 'desc' (descending)
      skip: Number of records to skip (for pagination)
      limit: Maximum records to return
      
    Example Queries:
      - Search by name:
        GET /departments/search?name=eng
        
      - Filter by size:
        GET /departments/search?min_employees=10&max_employees=50
        
      - Filter by salary:
        GET /departments/search?min_avg_salary=40000000
        
      - Combined filters with sorting:
        GET /departments/search?name=eng&sort_by=employee_count&order=desc
        
      - Pagination:
        GET /departments/search?skip=0&limit=10  (page 1)
